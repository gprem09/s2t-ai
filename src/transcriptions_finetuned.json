    "LJ001-0005": "The invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.",
    "LJ001-0006": "And it is worth mention in passing that as an example of fine typography.",
    "LJ001-0007": "The earliest book printed with movable types the guttenberg or forty two line bible of about fourteen fifty five.",
    "LJ001-0008": "Has never been surpassed.",
    "LJ001-0009": "Printing then for our purpose may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.",
    "LJ001-0010": "Now as all books not primarily intended as picture books consist principally of types composed to form letter press.",
    "LJ001-0011": "It is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form.",
    "LJ001-0012": "Especially as no more time is occupied or cost incurred incasting setting or printing beautiful letters.",
    "LJ001-0013": "An in the same operations with ugly ones.",
    "LJ001-0014": "And it was a matter of course that in the middle ages when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were.",
    "LJ001-0015": "The forms of printed letters should be beautiful and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.",
    "LJ001-0016": "The middle ages brought caligraphy to perfection and it was natural therefore.",
    "LJ001-0017": "That the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character and they followed them very closely.",
    "LJ001-0018": "The first books were printed in black letter i e the letter which was a gothic development of the ancient roman character.",
    "LJ001-0019": "And which developed more completely and satisfactorily on the side of the lower case than the capital letters.",
    "LJ001-0020": "The lower case being in fact invented in the early middle ages.",
    "LJ001-0021": "The earliest book printed with movable type the afforesaid guttenberg bible is printed in letters which are an exact imitation.",
    "LJ001-0022": "Of the more formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at that time this has since been called missiletype.",
    "LJ001-0023": "And was in fact the kind of letter used in the many splendid missiles salters et cetera produced by printing in the fifteenth century.",
    "LJ001-0024": "But the first bible actually dated which also was printed at maintes by peter choffer in the year fourteen sixty two.",
    "LJ001-0025": "Imitates a much freer hand simpler rounder and less spiky and therefore far pleasanter and easier to read.",
    "LJ001-0026": "On the whole the type of this book may be considered the neplu ultra of gothic type.",

    "LJ001-0032": "And used an exceedingly beautiful type which is indeed to look at a transition between gothic and roman.",
    "LJ001-0033": "But which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century m s s.",
    "LJ001-0034": "They printed very few books in this type three only but in their very first books in rome beginning with the year fourteen sixty eight.",
    "LJ001-0035": "They discarded this for a more completely roman and far less beautiful letter.",
    "LJ001-0036": "But about the same year menteline at strausburg began to print in a type which is distinctly roman.",
    "LJ001-0037": "And the next year gunther zeiner at augsburg followed suit.",
    "LJ001-0038": "While in fourteen seventy at paris udorich gerring and his associates turned out the first books printed in france also in rome in character.",
    "LJ001-0039": "The roman type of all these printers is similar in character.",
    "LJ001-0040": "And is very simple and legible and unaffectedly designed for use but it is by no means without beauty.",
    "LJ001-0041": "It must be said that it is in no way like the transition type of subiaco.",
    "LJ001-0042": "And though more roman than that yet scarcely more like the complete roman type of the earliest printers of rome.",
    "LJ001-0043": "Further development of the roman letter took place at venice.",

    "LJ001-0046": "Their type is on the lines of the german and french rather than of the roman printers.",
    "LJ001-0047": "Of jenson it must be said that he carried the development of roman type as far as it can go.",
    "LJ001-0048": "His letter is admirably clear and regular but at least as beautiful as any other rom an type.",
    "LJ001-0049": "After his death in the fourteen eighties or at least by fourteen ninety printing in venice had declined very much.",
    "LJ001-0050": "And though the famous family of aldos restored its technical excellence rejecting battered letters.",
    "LJ001-0051": "And paying great attention to the press work or actual process of printing.",
    "LJ001-0052": "Yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than gensin's and in fact.",
    "LJ001-0053": "They must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in italy.",
    "LJ001-0054": "Jensen however had many contemporaries who used beautiful type.",
    "LJ001-0055": "Some of which as e g that of jacobis rubius or jacques le ruge is scarcely distinguishable from his.",

    "LJ001-0057": "Parma and one or two other cities who produced the splendid editions of the classics which are one of the great glories of the printer's art.",
    "LJ001-0058": "And are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch by far.",
    "LJ001-0059": "The greater part of these italian printers it should be mentioned were germans or frenchmen working under the influence of italian opinion and aims.",
    "LJ001-0060": "Must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries.",
    "LJ001-0061": "The roman letter was used side by side with the gothic.",
    "LJ001-0062": "Even in italy most of the theological and law books were printed in gothic letter.",
    "LJ001-0063": "Which was generally more formally gothic than the printing of the german workmen.",
    "LJ001-0064": "Many of whose types indeed like that of the soubiaco works are of a transitional character.",
    "LJ001-0065": "This was notably the case with the early works printed at ome and in a somewhat lesser degree at augsburg.",
    "LJ001-0066": "In fact gunther ziner's first type afterwards used by schusler is remarkably like the type of the before mentioned subiaco books.",
    "LJ001-0067": "In the low countries and cologne which were very fertile of printed books gafick was the favorite.",
    "LJ001-0068": "The characteristic dutch type as represented by the excellent printer gerrade lieu is very pronounced and uncompromising gothic.",
    "LJ001-0069": "This type was introduced into england by winken de word caxton's successor.",
    "LJ001-0070": "And was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and indeed into the eighteenth.",
    "LJ001-0071": "Most of caxton's own types are of an earlier character though they also much resemble flemish or cologne letter.",
    "LJ001-0072": "After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing especially in germany and italy.",
    "LJ001-0073": "Went on apace and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done.",
    "LJ001-0074": "The best mostly french or low country was neat and clear but without any distinction.",
    "LJ001-0075": "The worst which perhaps was the english was a terrible falling off from the work of the earlier presses.",
    "LJ001-0076": "And things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.",
    "LJ001-0077": "In england about this time an attempt was made notably by caslon who started business in london as a type founder in seventeen twenty.",
    "LJ001-0078": "To improve the latter in form.",
    "LJ001-0079": "Caslon's type is clear and neat and fairly well designed.",
    "LJ001-0080": "He seems to have taken the letter f the elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model.",
    "LJ001-0081": "Type cast from his matresses is still in every day use.",
    "LJ001-0082": "In spite however of his praiseworthy efforts printing had still one last degradation to undergo.",
    "LJ001-0083": "The seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.",
    "LJ001-0084": "But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.",
    "LJ001-0085": "It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly and which it may be added.",
    "LJ001-0086": "Are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines.",
    "LJ001-0087": "For the seventeenth century letters are at least pure and simple in line the italian boudoni and the frenchman dido.",
    "LJ001-0088": "Were the leaders in this luckless change though our own baskerville who was at work some years before them went much on the same lines.",
    "LJ001-0089": "But his letters though uninteresting and poor are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the italian or the frenchman.",
    "LJ001-0090": "With this change the art of printing touched bottom.",
    "LJ001-0091": "So far as fine printing is concerned though paper did not get to its worst till about eighteen forty.",
    "LJ001-0092": "The chiswick press in eighteen forty four revived caslon's founcs printing for mesrs longmim the diary of lady willoughby.",
    "LJ001-0093": "This experiment was so far successful that about eighteen fifty mezzurs miller and richard of edinburgh.",
    "LJ001-0094": "Were induced to cut punches for a series of old style letters.",
    "LJ001-0095": "These and similar founts cast by the above firm and others.",
    "LJ001-0096": "Have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary modern style in use in england which is in fact the bodoni type.",
    "LJ001-0097": "A little reduced in ugliness the design of the letters of this modern old style leaves a good deal to be desired.",
    "LJ001-0098": "And the whole effect is a little too grey owing to the thinness of the letters.",
    "LJ001-0099": "It must be remembered however that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper and not by the hand press.",
    "LJ001-0100": "And these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.",
    "LJ001-0101": "It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to great britain.",
    "LJ001-0102": "Here and there a book is printed in france or germany with some pretension to good taste.",
    "LJ001-0103": "But the general revival of the old forms has made no way in those countries.",
    "LJ001-0104": "Italy is contentedly stagnant.",
    "LJ001-0105": "America has produced a good many showy books the typography paper and illustrations of which are however all wrong.",
    "LJ001-0106": "Oddity rather than rational beauty and meaning being apparently the things sought for both in the letters and the illustrations.",
    "LJ001-0107": "O say a few words on the principles of design in typography.",
    "LJ001-0108": "It is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters.",
    "LJ001-0109": "This is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections and by the using of careful purity of line.",
    "LJ001-0110": "Even the caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect.",
    "LJ001-0111": "The ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are hooked up in a vulgar and meaningless way.",
    "LJ001-0112": "Instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of genson's letters.",
    "LJ001-0113": "There is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c the a and so on.",
    "LJ001-0114": "And ugly pear shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter.",
    "LJ001-0115": "In short it happens to this craft as to others that the utilitarian practice though it professes to avoid ornament.",
    "LJ001-0116": "Still clings to a foolish because misunderstood conventionality deduced from what was wonce ornament and is by no means useful.",
    "LJ001-0117": "Which title can only be claimed by artistic practice whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.",
    "LJ001-0118": "In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type.",
    "LJ001-0119": "And the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the arabic numerals.",
    "LJ001-0120": "In the old print each figure has its definite individuality and one cannot be mistaken for the other.",
    "LJ001-0121": "In reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance.",
    "LJ001-0122": "He has a five and eight or a three before him unless the press work is of the best.",
    "LJ001-0123": "This is awkward if you have to read bradshaw's guide in a hurry.",
    "LJ001-0124": "One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity.",
    "LJ001-0125": "This is the narrowing of the modern letters.",
    "LJ001-0126": "Most of jenson's letters are designed within a square.",
    "LJ001-0127": "The modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design.",
    "LJ001-0128": "It is not a real gain for the modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately wide spaces between his lines which probably.",
    "LJ001-0129": "The lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.",
    "LJ001-0130": "Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading.",
    "LJ001-0131": "The size known as long primer ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read.",
    "LJ001-0132": "Here again if the practice of leading were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.",
    "LJ001-0133": "One very important matter in setting up for fine printing is the spacing that is the lateral distance of words from one another.",
    "LJ001-0134": "In good printing the spaces between words should be as near as possible equal.",
    "LJ001-0135": "It is impossible that they should be quite equal except in lines of poetry.",
    "LJ001-0136": "Modern printers understand this but it is only practised in the very best establishments.",
    "LJ001-0137": "But another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard.",
    "LJ001-0138": "This is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or rivers in the page.",
    "LJ001-0139": "A blemish which can be nearly though not wholly avoided by care and forethought.",
    "LJ001-0140": "The desirable thing being the breaking of the line as in bonding masonry or brickwork.",
    "LJ001-0141": "The general solidity of a page is much to be sought for.",
    "LJ001-0142": "Modern printers generally overdo the whites in the spacing a defect probably forced on them by the characterless quality of the letters.",
    "LJ001-0143": "For where these are boldly and carefully designed and each letter is thoroughly individual in form.",
    "LJ001-0144": "The words may be sait much closer together without loss of clearness.",
    "LJ001-0145": "No definite rules however except the avoidance of rivers and excess of white can be given for the spacing.",
    "LJ001-0146": "Which requires the constant exercise of judgment and taste on the part of the printer.",
    "LJ001-0147": "The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look.",
    "LJ001-0148": "Here once more the almost invariable modern practice is in opposition to a natural sense of proportion.",
    "LJ001-0149": "From the time when books first took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth century or indeed later.",
    "LJ001-0150": "The page so lay on the paper that there was more space allowed to the bottom and fore margin than to the top and back of the paper.",
    "LJ001-0151": "The unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming an opening.",
    "LJ001-0152": "The modern printer in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes considers the single page as the unit and prints the page in the middle of his paper.",
    "LJ001-0153": "Only nominally so however in many cases since when he uses a headline he counts that in.",
    "LJ001-0154": "The result as measured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one and that the whole opening has an upside down look vertically.",
    "LJ001-0155": "And that laterlly the page looks as if it were being driven off the paper.",
    "LJ001-0156": "The paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary part of our subject.",
    "LJ001-0157": "Of this it may be said that though there is some good paper made now.",
    "LJ001-0158": "Is never used except for very expensive books although it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest.",
    "LJ001-0159": "The paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad even in this country but is beaten in the race for vileness.",
    "LJ001-0160": "By that made in america which is the worst conceivable.",
    "LJ001-0161": "There seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made.",
    "LJ001-0162": "Even allowing the necessity for a very low price but any improvement must be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap.",
    "LJ001-0163": "E g the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a smooth and white surface.",
    "LJ001-0164": "Which should be indications of a delicacy of material and manufacture which would of necessity increase its cost.",
    "LJ001-0165": "One fruitful source of badness in paper.",
    "LJ001-0166": "Is the habit that publishers have of eking out a thin volume by printing it on thick paper almost of the substance of cardboard.",
    "LJ001-0167": "A device which deceives nobody and makes a book very unpleasant to read.",
    "LJ001-0168": "On the whole a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent.",
    "LJ001-0169": "The paper used for printing the small highly ornamented french service books about the beginning of the sixteenth century is a model in this respect.",
    "LJ001-0170": "Being thin tough and opaque.",
    "LJ001-0171": "However the fact must not be blinked that machine made paper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as that made by hand.",
    "LJ001-0172": "The ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt with fully here but one thing must be said on it.",
    "LJ001-0173": "The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament whatever it is whether picture or pattern work should form part of the page.",
    "LJ001-0174": "Should be a part of the whole scheme of the buck.",
    "LJ001-0175": "Simple as this proposition is it is necessary to be stated.",
    "LJ001-0176": "Because the modern practice is  to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether.",
    "LJ001-0177": "So that if the two are helpful to one another it is a mere matter of accident.",
    "LJ001-0178": "The due relation of letter to pictures and other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old printers so that.",
    "LJ001-0179": "Even when the wood cuts are very rude indeed.",
    "LJ001-0180": "The proportions of the page still give pleasure by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey.",
    "LJ001-0181": "When as is most often the case there is actual beauty in the cuts.",
    "LJ001-0182": "The books so ornamented are amongst the most delightful works of art that have ever been produced.",
    "LJ001-0183": "Therefore granted well designed type due spacing of the lines and words and proper position of the page on the paper.",
    "LJ001-0184": "All books might be at least comely and well looking and if to these good qualities were added really beautiful ornament and pictures.",
    "LJ001-0185": "Printed books might once again illustrate to the full.",
    "LJ001-0186": "The position of our society that a work of utility might be also a work of art if we cared to make it so.",
    "LJ002-0001": "The chronicles of newgate volume two by arthur griffiths section four newgate down to eighteen eighteen.",
    "LJ002-0002": "Under the  conditions referred to in the previous chapter.",
    "LJ002-0003": "With criminals and misdemeanants of all shades crowding perpetually into its narrow limits the latter state of newgate was worse than the first.",
    "LJ002-0004": "The new jail fell as far short of the demands made on it as did the old.",
    "LJ002-0005": "The prison population fluctuated a great deal.",
    "LJ002-0006": "But it was almost always in excess of the accommodation available and there were times when the place was full to overflowing.",
    "LJ002-0007": "Kneeled gives some figures which well illustrate this.",
    "LJ002-0008": "On the fourteenth june eighteen hundred there were one hundred ninety nine debtors and two hundred eighty nine fellons in the prison.",
    "LJ002-0009": "On the twenty seventh april in the following year.",
    "LJ002-0010": "These numbers had risen to two hundred seventy five and three hundred seventy five respectively or six hundred fifty in all.",
    "LJ002-0011": "For two more years these high figures were steadily maintained and in eighteen o three the total rose to seven hundred ten.",
    "LJ002-0012": "After that they fell as steadily.",
    "LJ002-0013": "Till eighteen o eight the lowest point was touched of one hundred ninety seven debtors and one hundred eighty two felons or three hundred seventy nine in all.",
    "LJ002-0014": "The numbers soon increased however and by eighteen eleven had again risen to six hundred twenty nine and mister nield was told that there had been at one time.",
    "LJ002-0015": "Three hundred debtors and nine hundred criminals in newgate or twelve hundred prisoners in all.",
    "LJ002-0016": "Previous to that date there had been seven hundred or eight hundred frequently and once in mister aykerman's time one thousand.",
    "LJ002-0017": "Trustworthy evidence is forthcoming to the effect that these high figures were constantly maintained for many months at a time.",
    "LJ002-0018": "The inadequacy of the jail was noticed and reported upon again and again by the grand juries of the city of london.",
    "LJ002-0019": "Who seldom let a session go by without visiting newgate.",

    "LJ006-0056": "Some rooms remained quite empty and unoccupied while others were full to overflowing.",
    "LJ006-0057": "Not only were the words thus needlessly crammed and for no reason but the niggardliness of the corporation which refused a proper supply of bedding.",

    "LJ006-0079": "The inspectors found that prisoners had their places assigned to them.",

    "LJ006-0083": "So great is the authority exercised by him.",
    "LJ006-0084": "And so numerous were his opportunities of showing favoritism that all the prisoners may be said to be in his power.",
    "LJ006-0085": "If a man is poor and ragged however inexperienced in crime or however trifling may be the offence for which he has been committed.",
    "LJ006-0086": "His place is assigned among the most depraved the most experienced and the most incorrigible offenders in the middle yard.",
    "LJ006-0087": "It must be admitted that so far but little effort had been made to counteract the evils of indiscriminate association.",
    "LJ006-0088": "It was not likely that a system which left innocent men for the great bulk of new arrivals were still untried.",
    "LJ006-0089": "To be pitchforked by chance anywhere into any sort of company.",
    "LJ006-0090": "Within this the greatest nursery of crime in london should exercise even the commonest care for the personal decency or comfort of the prisoners.",
    "LJ006-0091": "Their treatment was also a matter of chance they still slept on rope mats on the floor hurried together in companies of four or more to keep one another warm.",
    "LJ006-0092": "And under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable rugs apiece.",

    "LJ006-0094": "Sometimes two mats were allotted to three sleepers sometimes four slept under the same bedding and left their mats unoccupied.",
    "LJ006-0095": "The rugs used were never washed an order existed that the bedding should be taken into the yards to be eired but it was not very punctually obeyed.",
    "LJ006-0096": "The only convenience for personal ablutions were the pumps in the yards and the far off baths in the condemned or press yard.",
    "LJ006-0097": "Water might not be taken into the ward for washing purposes.",

    "LJ006-0100": "Many without stockings and with hardly shoes to their feet.",

    "LJ006-0103": "The allowance of food was not illiberal.",
    "LJ006-0104": "But its issue was precarious and dependent on the good will of the wardsman who measured out the portions to each according to his eye.",

    "LJ006-0108": "He charged a weekly sum as ward dues for the use of knives forks and plates.",
    "LJ006-0109": "A perpetuation under another form of the old detestable custom of garnish.",
    "LJ006-0110": "He had power where his exactions were resisted of making the ward most uncomfortable for the defaulter.",
    "LJ006-0111": "He could trump up a false complaint against his fellow prisoner and so get him punished.",
    "LJ006-0112": "He might keep him from the fire or give him his soup or grule in a pail instead of a basin.",
    "LJ006-0113": "The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted and so entirely unchecked degenerated into a baneful despotism.",
    "LJ006-0114": "They bought their offices from one another and were thus considered to have a vested interest in them.",
    "LJ006-0115": "Their original capital had been a few shillings and for this they purchased the right to tax their fellows to the extent of pounds per week.",
    "LJ006-0116": "The wardsman had a monopoly in supplying provisions gave dinner and breakfast at his own price and was such complete master of the ward.",

    "LJ006-0119": "When the wardsman was a man of some education with some knowledge of legal chicanery gained by personal experience he might add considerably to his emoluments.",
    "LJ006-0120": "By drawing briefs and petitions for his fellows there was a recognized charge of five shillings per brief.",
    "LJ006-0121": "For a petition of from one shilling halfpence to eight shillings according to its length.",
    "LJ006-0122": "And by these payments a wardsman had been known to a mass as much as forty pounds.",
    "LJ006-0123": "The man entrusted with this privilege was often the inner gatesman.",
    "LJ006-0124": "The prisoner official already mentioned who held the fate of new arrivals as regards location in his hands.",
    "LJ006-0125": "It was not strange that he should sometimes misuse his power and when prisoners were not to be cajoled into securing his legal services.",
    "LJ006-0126": "Had been known to employ threats declaring that he was often consulted by the governor as to a prisoner's character.",
    "LJ006-0127": "In view of speaking to it at the trial and he could easily do them a good turn or a very bad one.",
    "LJ006-0128": "The brief drawing gatesman and wardsman at the time of the inspector's first visit must have been a particularly powerful personage.",

    "LJ006-0130": "Had a key of both the master's side and middle side yards was the only person present at the distribution of beer and was trusted to examine.",

    "LJ006-0136": "These wardsmen besides thus ruling the roast had numerous special privileges if such they can be called.",
    "LJ006-0137": "They were not obliged to attend chapel and seldom if ever went prisoners said one of them under examination did not like the trouble of going to chapel.",
    "LJ006-0138": "They had a standing bedstead to sleep on and a good flock mattress double allowance of provisions filched from the common stock.",

    "LJ006-0147": "It was still freely introduced into the prison.",
    "LJ006-0148": "Probably authority would not have been so recklessly usurped by the wardsmen had not the proper officials too readily surrendered it.",

    "LJ016-0026": "Managed to get away in the very same spot where his namesake had nine years before so miserably failed.",
    "LJ016-0027": "Escape seemed absolutely hopeless.",
    "LJ016-0028": "And would certainly have been impossible to any one less nimble than a chimney sweep trained under the old system to ascend the most intricate flues.",
    "LJ016-0029": "Even after williams had got out persons were disposed to disbelieve that the esccape had been accomplished in the manner indicated.",
    "LJ016-0030": "They preferred to credit it to carelessness or collusion from officers of the jail.",
    "LJ016-0031": "Yet from the circumstantial account given by williams after recapture there can be little doubt that he got away as will be described.",
    "LJ016-0032": "Williams  as a capital convict was lodged in the press yard or condemned ward.",
    "LJ016-0033": "He had access to the eiring yard and there was for hours no kind of supervision.",
    "LJ016-0034": "In one corner of the eiring yard stood a cistern at some height from the ground.",
    "LJ016-0035": "The wall beneath and above it was rusticated in other words the granite surface had become roughened and offered a sort of foothold.",
    "LJ016-0036": "About fifty feet from the ground level and above the cistern a revolving chevau de fris of iron was fixed.",
    "LJ016-0037": "With only a short interval between it and the wall supported by a horizontal iron railing with upright points.",
    "LJ016-0038": "In the wall above the chevaux de frise projected a series of iron spikes sharp enough to forbid further ascent.",
    "LJ016-0039": "Williams surveyed these formidable obstacles to evasion and calmly proceeded to surmount them.",
    "LJ016-0040": "His first task was to gain the top of the cistern this he effected by keeping his back to one side of the angle.",
    "LJ016-0041": "And working with his hands behind him while he used his bare feet like claws upon the other side of the wall angle.",
    "LJ016-0042": "The condition of the stone surface just mentioned assisted him in this and he managed to get beyond the cistern to the railing below the chevaux de frise.",
    "LJ016-0043": "The least slip now would have been fatal to him but he could not thrust his body in through the narrow space left by the chevaux de frise.",
    "LJ016-0044": "And was compelled to work along the railing round three quarters of the square of the yard.",
    "LJ016-0045": "And at length reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards this had been a perilous and painful task.",
    "LJ016-0046": "The spikes of the railing penetrated his flesh and made progression slow and difficult.",
    "LJ016-0047": "But the worst part of the business was to jump from this irksome foothold of the iron grating on to the top of the building just mentioned.",
    "LJ016-0048": "A distance of eight or nine feet.",
    "LJ016-0049": "He had here completed his assent.",
    "LJ016-0050": "His next job was to descend outside newgate.",
    "LJ016-0051": "Clambering along the roof.",
    "LJ016-0052": "He passed to the top of the ordinary's residence hoping to find an open skylight by which he might enter and so work downstairs.",
    "LJ016-0053": "If the worst came to the worst he intended to have gone down some chimney as he had often done before in the way of business.",
    "LJ016-0054": "But he did not like the risk of entering a room by the fireplace and the chances of detection it offered.",
    "LJ016-0055": "He traversed vainly all the roofs in nuwgate street.",
    "LJ016-0056": "Running a great risk of discovery as he passed by a lot of workmen at tyler's manufactory in warwick square which had formerly been the college of physicians.",
    "LJ016-0057": "As his coat was an incumbrance he left it on the top of the third house in newgate street and thus in shirt sleeves barefoot and bare headed.",
    "LJ016-0058": "He worked along to the roofs in warwick lane.",
    "LJ016-0059": "Here he came upon a woman on the leads hanging out clothes to dry.",
    "LJ016-0060": "Williams concealed himself behind a chimney till she had re entered her garret.",
    "LJ016-0061": "And then following her down a step ladder into the house told his story appealed to and won her compassion.",
    "LJ016-0062": "She suffered him to pass downstairs.",
    "LJ016-0063": "Below he met another woman and a girl both of whom were terrified at his appearance but.",
    "LJ016-0064": "When he explained that he was running away from the gallows they left him the road clear.",
    "LJ016-0065": "To walk out into the street was an easy affair and he was now free with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.",
    "LJ016-0066": "Denied admission everywhere as a ragged half naked beggar.",
    "LJ016-0067": "He tramped across london bridge to wandsworth where he refreshed himself with a pint of strong ale the first sustenance he had taken since his escape.",
    "LJ016-0068": "And continued his march to kingston where he slept soundly under a hedge till next morning.",
    "LJ016-0069": "Entering a town he obtained employment at once as a chimney suite.",
    "LJ016-0070": "From a widow woman who gave him bub and grub or food and one and sixpence for every nine days work.",
    "LJ016-0071": "Dissatisfied with this remuneration he again took to the road and tramped into hampshire.",
    "LJ016-0072": "Where he presently committed a burglary at lymington was caught and lodged in winchester jail.",
    "LJ016-0073": "Mister cope the governor of newgate having been communicated with proceeded to winchester where he at once identified williams.",
    "LJ016-0074": "The success although very short lived which attended him no doubt inspired other inmates of newgate to follow his example.",
    "LJ016-0075": "It was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hope of escaping by the flue.",
    "LJ016-0076": "Even then however irons across barred the ascent after a certain distance and in no one case did a fugitive get clear away.",
    "LJ016-0077": "A man named lears under sentence of transportation for an attempt at murger on board ship got up part of the way.",
    "LJ016-0078": "But had to come down again covered with soot and filth just as the officers entered the ward.",
    "LJ016-0079": "Leers was rewarded by being obliged to wear cross irons on his legs a punishment rarely inflicted in newgate.",
    "LJ016-0080": "And probably one of the few cases of a recurrence but under proper safeguards and limitations to the old system of chains.",
    "LJ016-0081": "On another occasion mister cope the governor came in and missed a man.",
    "LJ016-0082": "The ward was one short of its number what had become of the fellow.",
    "LJ016-0084": "The fugitive uncomfortably in skonce to in the flue came down of his own accord like colonel colt's racoon.",
    "LJ016-0085": "After this great iron guards just as are to be seen in lunatic asylums.",
    "LJ016-0086": "Were fixed over the fireplaces and the prisoners had no longer access to the chimneys.",
    "LJ016-0087": "Among the escapes still remembered was one in eighteen forty nine accomplished by a man who had been employed.",
    "LJ016-0088": "Working at the roof of the chapel on the female side.",
    "LJ016-0089": "Was engaged in whitewashing and cleaning the officer who had him in charge left him on the stairs leading to the gallery.",
    "LJ016-0090": "Taking advantage of being unobserved he got out through the roof onto the leads and travelled along them towards number one newgate street.",
    "LJ016-0091": "This was a public house.",
    "LJ016-0092": "He stepped in at a garret window coolly walked downstairs and entered the bar.",
    "LJ016-0093": "They asked him how he had cut his hand which was bleeding and he said he had done it while working up on the roof.",
    "LJ016-0094": "No further notice was taken of him no one seemingly suspected that he was a prisoner and he was suffered to walk off without let or hindrance.",
    "LJ016-0095": "In eighteen fifty three three men escaped in company from one of the wards in the middle yard.",
    "LJ016-0096": "They were penal servitude men their names bell brown and barry and they were awaiting transfer to leycester.",
    "LJ016-0097": "Which with wakefield was utilized as a receptacle for convicts not going to western australia.",
    "LJ016-0098": "Or any of the new establishments at home at portland dartmore or elsewhere.",
    "LJ016-0099": "These men managed to cut a hole in the seiling of the ward near the iron cage on the landing and so got access to the roof.",
    "LJ016-0100": "At that time roped mats were still used as beds.",
    "LJ016-0101": "One of the three shamming ill remained all day in his ward where he employed himself on ravelling the rope from the sleeping mats.",
    "LJ016-0102": "By evening he manufactured a good long length.",
    "LJ016-0103": "And after all was quiet the three got on to the roof through the hole and so on to tyler's manufactory close by.",
    "LJ016-0104": "Whence they let themselves down into the street by the rope.",
    "LJ016-0105": "These men were all in prison dress at the time of their escape but one of their number belle sent back his clothes a few days later by parcel's delivery.",
    "LJ016-0106": "With a civil note to the governor saying he had no further use for them all three fugitives were recaptured.",
    "LJ016-0107": "Brown almost at once then barry who was taken at the east end in a public house where he had arranged to meet a pal.",
    "LJ016-0108": "The newgate officers obtained information of this and went to the spot where they effected the capture.",
    "LJ016-0109": "But not till they had had an exciting chase down the street.",
    "LJ016-0110": "The third bell remained longest at large he too was run into at a lodging in the kingsland road.",
    "LJ016-0111": "The officers dropped on to him while he was still in bed but as they came upstairs he jumped up and hid in a cupboard.",
    "LJ016-0112": "All three after recapture passed on as originally intended to leycester where they did their bit and were released.",
    "LJ016-0113": "But only to be taken soon afterwards for a fresh offence and again passed through newgate with sentences of penal servitude.",
    "LJ016-0114": "A later case was still more remarkable as it was effected after the alteration of the prison and its reconstruction on the newest lines.",
    "LJ016-0115": "A sailor craps by name occupied one of the upper cells in the new block.",
    "LJ016-0116": "The doors through incomplete knowledge of prison needs were not as now sheeted with iron.",
    "LJ016-0117": "The prisoner had nothing to deal with but wooden panels and by dint of cutting and chopping he got both the lower panels out.",
    "LJ016-0118": "Through the aperture he crept out on to the landing at the dead of night and so down into the central space of the building.",
    "LJ016-0119": "Under superior orders all the doors and gates of this block were left open at night to allow the night watchman to pass freely to all parts.",
    "LJ016-0120": "Was considered safer than intrusting him with keys.",
    "LJ016-0121": "Crapps walked at once into the yard and across to the female side where he found some of the washings still hanging out to dry.",
    "LJ016-0122": "He made a strong rope with several of the sheets then returning to the male yard.",
    "LJ016-0123": "Got hold of the step ladder used in alighting the gas and which under our more careful supervision would have been as nowa days chained up.",
    "LJ016-0124": "Cutting the cord which fastened the two legs of the step ladder he opened them out and made one long length.",
    "LJ016-0125": "With this placed against the wall nether chevau de frise he made an escalade.",
    "LJ016-0126": "The top of the wall was gained without difficulty.",
    "LJ016-0127": "Along this craps crawled and then dropped down on to the cook house.",
    "LJ016-0128": "He now put in requisition the rope made of the sheets and with its help lowered himself into the street.",
    "LJ016-0129": "Down below were market carts waiting for daylight and among them kraps found a refuge and friends.",
    "LJ016-0130": "The first intimation of his escape was afforded by the police who informed the prison authorities next day that a rope was hanging down from the cook house roof.",
    "LJ016-0131": "Nothing more was heard of craps the curious thing in his case was that his offence was a trifling one.",
    "LJ016-0132": "He was still untried but would almost certainly have escaped with a minor penalty say of three or four months imprisonment.",
    "LJ016-0133": "There is however no explanation of the motives which prompt prisoners to attempt escapes.",
    "LJ016-0134": "Hases well authenticated have been known of men who had all but completed their sentences and for whom the prison gates would open within a few days.",
    "LJ016-0135": "Who yet faced extraordinary risks to advance their enlargement by only a few hours.",
    "LJ016-0136": "On the other hand at the great convict establishments such as the moral restraint of a systematic discipline.",
    "LJ016-0137": "That numbers of men lifers and others with ten fourteen or twenty years to do can be trusted to work out of doors without bolts and bars.",
    "LJ016-0138": "At a distance from the prison.",
    "LJ016-0139": "The last escape from newgate was only three years ago and occurred just before the final closing of the prison.",
    "LJ016-0140": "No report of it was made public as the man was almost immediately recaptured.",
    "LJ016-0141": "He was at work under the supervision of the artisan warder of the prison.",

    "LJ016-0143": "He was out of sight while so employed and remained so long absent that the warder becoming uneasy went in search of him.",
    "LJ016-0144": "He had disappeared.",
    "LJ016-0145": "Encouraged by the shouts and signals of some workmen employed on a building outside the prisoner made one of the most marvellous jumps on record.",
    "LJ016-0146": "From the building he was on to a distant wall with a drop of sixty feet between.",
    "LJ016-0147": "Then he ran along the coping of the wall towards its angle with tyler's manufactory and dropped down on to the grid iron below.",
    "LJ016-0148": "This was not strong enough to carry him and he fell through.",
    "LJ016-0149": "Suicides and executions were however always the most effectual methods of making exit from durance.",
    "LJ016-0150": "Suicides at newgate were numerous enough but they seldom possessed any novel or unusual features.",
    "LJ016-0151": "Prison suicides seldom do except as regards ingennuity and determination.",
    "LJ016-0152": "Only great resolution indeed persisted in to the bitter end.",
    "LJ016-0153": "Would make death a certainty so limited and imperfect are the means generally available.",
    "LJ016-0154": "When a bit of rope carefully secreted.",
    "LJ016-0155": "Braces shoe strings shirt torn into strip are the only instruments and a bar or small hook.",
    "LJ016-0156": "At no elevation affords the only drop strangulation would seldom supervene but for the resolution of the miserable felau de ce.",
    "LJ016-0157": "One curious instance of a suicide carried out under the most adverse and extraordinary circumstances may be quoted.",
    "LJ016-0158": "It was that of a long firm swindler by name johnson.",
    "LJ016-0159": "Who contrived to hang himself from a hammock hook only eighteen inches from the ground.",
    "LJ016-0160": "The noose was one of his hammock straps which he buckled round his throat.",
    "LJ016-0161": "Having carefully spread out a blanket on the floor just below the hammock as it lay suspended.",
    "LJ016-0162": "He fastened one end of the strap above mentioned to the hook and then fell down.",
    "LJ016-0163": "He might have saved himself at any moment by merely extending an arm but he lay there patiently till death supervened.",
    "LJ016-0164": "When discovered next morning quite dead it was found that the strap actually did not touch his throat.",
    "LJ016-0165": "Three fingers might have been inserted between it and the flesh the pressure was all on the arteries behind the ears.",
    "LJ016-0166": "And surgical opinion stated that the stoppage of circulation was the cause of death.",
    "LJ016-0167": "Probably dissolution came as easily and almost without pain.",
    "LJ016-0168": "A laudable desire to invest executions with more and more solemnity and decorum gained ground as they became more rare.",
    "LJ016-0169": "As more humane principles were introduced into prison management.",
    "LJ016-0170": "Greater attention was paid to the capital convicts and the horrors of their situation while awaiting sentence.",
    "LJ016-0171": "Were as far as possible mitigated entone down but there was little improvement in the ceremony itself.",
    "LJ016-0172": "There were still untoward accidents occasionally at executions and even the chief practitioner of recent times cawkraft.",
    "LJ016-0173": "Was not always to be trusted to do his fell work efficiently.",
    "LJ016-0174": "Having mentioned calcraft's name.",
    "LJ016-0175": "I may be permitted to digress for a moment to give a few particulars concerning the last officially appointed hangman of the city of london.",
    "LJ016-0176": "After calkraft's resignation no successor was really appointed.",
    "LJ016-0177": "Marwood whose name is so familiar with the present generation.",

    "LJ016-0185": "Calkraft who in spite of the dreadful calling he subsequently followed was always reputed a kindly man.",
    "LJ016-0186": "Invited the man with the cough to enter a neighbouring house and try a little peppermint for it.",
    "LJ016-0187": "The other accepted and they got into conversation.",
    "LJ016-0188": "He told calkraft that he was foxen the executioner and that he was that moment on his way to newgate to hang a man.",
    "LJ016-0189": "But that his cough was getting so much the master of him that he feared he would not be able to carry on his duties much longer.",
    "LJ016-0190": "I have no idea who the sheriffs will get to do the work after me said foxen adding that his assistant tom chesher.",
    "LJ016-0191": "Was given to drink and not to be trusted.",
    "LJ016-0192": "I think i could do that sort of job said calcraft on the spur of the moment.",
    "LJ016-0193": "Foxen asked him his name in a dress and went away.",
    "LJ016-0194": "Calkraft thought no more of what had occurred till the next sessions at the old bailey when the sheriffs sent for him.",
    "LJ016-0195": "And offered him the post of executioner for the city of london and middle sex.",
    "LJ016-0196": "He accepted having at first tom chesher as his assistant then for a time when chesher was dismissed for drunkenness a man named osborne.",
    "LJ016-0197": "After that he worked alone.",
    "LJ016-0198": "I cannot find that calkraft was sworn in when appointed or any exact information when the old forbidding ceremony ceased to be practised.",
    "LJ016-0199": "It was customary to make the executioner take the bible in his hand and swear solemnly that he would despatch every criminal condemned to die.",
    "LJ016-0200": "Without favoring father or mother or any other relation or friend.",
    "LJ016-0201": "When he had taken the oath he was dismissed with the words get thee hence wretch.",
    "LJ016-0202": "Calkraft's amoluments were a guinea per week and an extra guinea for every execution.",
    "LJ016-0203": "He got besides half a crown for every man he flogged and an allowance to provide cats or birch rods.",

    "LJ016-0205": "He received a retaining fee o five pound five shillings with the usual guinea for each job.",
    "LJ016-0206": "He was also at liberty to engage himself in the country where he demanded and was paid ten pounds on each occasion.",
    "LJ016-0207": "It was not always easy to get a hangman so cheap as i have already indicated on a previous page.",
    "LJ016-0208": "The onests and responsibility of carrying out the sentence is personal to the sheriff a good story is told illustrating this.",
    "LJ016-0209": "Some wags in scotland seized calkraft and kept him endurance the night before the execution.",
    "LJ016-0210": "Meanwhile the convener or sheriff was in despair expecting that failing the executioner he would have to do the job himself.",
    "LJ016-0211": "But fortunately for him just at the last moment cowcraft was set free.",
    "LJ016-0212": "Councraft's salary was more than the proverbial thirteenpence halfpenny hangman's wages.",
    "LJ016-0213": "The origin of this expression dates it is said from the time when the scottish mark.",
    "LJ016-0214": "A silver coin bearing the same relation to the scottish pound that an english shilling does to an english pound was made to pass current in england.",
    "LJ016-0215": "The mark was valued at thirteenpence halfpenny or rather more than the shilling which from time immemorial had been the hangman's wages.",
    "LJ016-0216": "That very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by calcraft and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it.",

    "LJ016-0221": "Calkraft consented got and bestowed the clothes only to find that the person he had obliged exhibited them publicly.",
    "LJ016-0222": "It may be added that of late years the clothes in which a convict has suffered are invariably burnt.",
    "LJ016-0223": "Capital convicts go to the gallows in their own clothing and not in prison dress unless the former is quite unfit to be worn.",
    "LJ016-0224": "Calkraft shared the odium which his office not strangely has always inspired but he was admitted into the jail.",
    "LJ016-0225": "Which his predecessors were not and who were paid their wages over the gate to obviate the necessity for letting them enter.",
    "LJ016-0226": "To this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared the yeoman of the halter.",
    "LJ016-0227": "Whose business it was to provide the rope and do the pinioning and who was paid a fee of five shillings.",
    "LJ016-0228": "They did not dislike calkraft however at newgate he was an illiterate simple minded man who scarcely remembered what executions he had performed.",

    "LJ016-0231": "When he came to the prison for his wages his grandchildren often accompanied him affectionately clinging to his hands.",

    "LJ016-0233": "In his own profession.",
    "LJ016-0234": "He was not unskilful but he preceeded entirely by rule of thumb leaving the result very much to chance and the strength of the rope.",
    "LJ016-0235": "He was so much in favour of shortdrops that his immediate success or marwood stigmatized him as shortdropped man.",
    "LJ016-0236": "Marwood being on the other hand in favour of giving a man as much rope as possible.",
    "LJ016-0237": "With calkraft's method there were undoubtedly many failures and it was a common custom for him to go below the gallows.",
    "LJ016-0238": "Just to steady their legs a little in other words to add his weight to that of the hanging bodies.",
    "LJ016-0239": "Marwood till latterly seemed to have done his work more effectually and has been known to give as much as six feet fall.",
    "LJ016-0240": "This generally produces instantaneous death although cases where complete fracture of the spial cord occurred are said to be rare.",

    "LJ017-0030": "When the spread of scientific knowledge places nefarious means at the disposal of many.",

    "LJ017-0043": "The direful suspicions which surrounded the case filled the whole country with uneasiness and misgiving.",

    "LJ017-0045": "The central criminal court was crowded to suffocation.",
    "LJ017-0046": "Great personages occupied seats upon the bench.",

    "LJ017-0105": "Cook's death was horrible.",

    "LJ017-0114": "The intestines were however preserved and sent for analysis.",
    "LJ017-0115": "But it was proved that palmer tried hard to get possession of the jar containing them.",
    "LJ017-0116": "And even sought to upset the vehicle by which they were being conveyed  a part of the way to london.",
    "LJ017-0117": "The examination of the stomach betrayed the presence of antimony in large quantities but no strichnea.",
    "LJ017-0118": "And it was on the entire absence of the latter that the defence was principally based when palmer was brought to trial.",
    "LJ017-0119": "All the circumstances were so suspicious that he could not escape the criminal charge.",
    "LJ017-0120": "He had already been arrested on a writ issued at the instance of the money lenders and an action had been commenced against missus palmer on her acceptances.",
    "LJ017-0121": "It came out at once that these had been forged and the whole affair at once took the ugliest complexion.",
    "LJ017-0122": "A government prosecution was instituted and palmer was brought to newgate for trial at the central criminal court.",
    "LJ017-0123": "There was not much reserve about him when there.",
    "LJ017-0124": "He frequently declared before and during the trial that it would be impossible to find him guilty.",
    "LJ017-0125": "He never actually said that he was not guilty but he was confident he would not be convicted.",
    "LJ017-0126": "He relied on the absence of the strichnea.",
    "LJ017-0127": "But the chain of circumstantial evidence was strong enough to satisfy the jury who agreed to their verdict in an hour.",
    "LJ017-0128": "At the last moment palmer tossed a bit of paper over to his counsel on which he had written quote i think there will be a verdict of not guilty and qute.",
    "LJ017-0129": "Even after the death sentence had been passed upon him he clung to the hope that the government would grant him a reprieve.",
    "LJ017-0130": "To the last therefore he played the part of a man wrongfully convicted and did not abandon hope.",

    "LJ017-0136": "With exquisite torture and with a poison that would leave as he thought no trace.",
    "LJ017-0137": "In the latter hope he was happily disappointed but as this case is beyond my subject i merely mention it as one of the group already referred to.",
    "LJ017-0138": "Three years later came the case of doctor smethurst.",
    "LJ017-0139": "Presenting still greater features of resemblance with palmers for both were medical men and both raised difficult questions of medical jurisprudence.",
    "LJ017-0140": "In both the jury had no doubt as to the guilt of the accused only in smethurst's case the then home secretary sir george cornwall lewis.",
    "LJ017-0141": "Could not divest his mind of serious doubt and of which the murderer got the benefit.",
    "LJ017-0142": "Smethurst's escape may have influenced the jury in the poplar poisoning case.",
    "LJ017-0143": "Which followed close on its heels although in that the verdict of not guilty was excusable as the evidence was entirely circumstantial.",
    "LJ017-0144": "There was no convincing proof that the accused had administered the poison although beyond question that poison had occasioned the death.",
    "LJ017-0145": "Doctor smethurst was long an inmate of newgate and was tried at the central criminal court.",
    "LJ017-0146": "He had all the characteristics of the poisoner the calm deliberation.",

    "LJ017-0152": "In spite of the existence of the other missus smedhurst.",
    "LJ017-0153": "Probably the doctor had told her the story he brought forward when tried for bigamy namely.",
    "LJ017-0154": "That missus smedhurst had no right to the name but had a husband of her own one johnson alive a story subsequently disproved.",
    "LJ017-0155": "Miss bank's seems to have counted upon some species of whitewashing no less than the repudiation of the other marriage.",
    "LJ017-0156": "And told her sister as much when they last met.",
    "LJ017-0157": "For some months smethurst and miss banks lived together as man and wife first in london and then at richmond.",
    "LJ017-0158": "She had a little fortune of her own some one thousand seven hundred pounds or one thousand eight hundred pounds.",
    "LJ017-0159": "And a life interest in five thousand pounds a fact on which smethurst's councel dwelt with much weight.",
    "LJ017-0160": "As indicating  a motive for keeping her alive rather than killing her.",
    "LJ017-0161": "But probably the lump sum was the bait or perhaps smethurst' wished to return to his temporarily deserted first wife.",
    "LJ017-0162": "Whatever the exact cause which impelled him to crime it seems certain that he began to give her some poison.",
    "LJ017-0163": "Either arcenic or antimony or both in small quantities.",
    "LJ017-0164": "With the idea of subjecting her to the irritant poison slowly but surely until the desired effect death was achieved.",
    "LJ017-0165": "As she became worse and worse smethurst called in the best medical advice in richmond.",

    "LJ017-0167": "Smethurst was found guilty by the jury and sentenced to death.",
    "LJ017-0168": "But a long public discussion followed and in consequence he was reprieved.",

    "LJ017-0170": "There is not absolute and complete evidence of his guilt and te.",
    "LJ017-0171": "Smethurst was therefore given a free pardon for the offence of murder.",

    "LJ017-0198": "But its nature was betrayed when this last victim also died.",
    "LJ017-0199": "The first postmortem indicated death from natural causes.",
    "LJ017-0200": "But a more careful investigation attributed it beyond doubt to overdoses of colchicum.",

    "LJ019-0105": "And that a new system of prison discipline should be introduced.",

    "LJ019-0113": "The scheme was no doubt fascinating and in many respects feasible.",

    "LJ019-0117": "That industry might thus be stimulated and encouraged was probable enough.",

    "LJ019-0122": "Mister peerson seems to have taken for granted that all prisoners would behave well in his district prisons.",
    "LJ019-0123": "On that account he made no provision to ensure safe custody.",
    "LJ019-0124": "Thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord.",

    "LJ019-0126": "The creation of an expensive staff for supervision.",
    "LJ019-0127": "Or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm would have greatly added to the charges of these establishments.",

    "LJ019-0132": "In the inquiry which followed attention was again attracted to newgate.",
    "LJ019-0133": "The condition of that prison in eighteen fifty may be gathered from the pages of the report not much had been done to remedy the old defects.",
    "LJ019-0134": "Radical improvement was generally considered impossible the great evil however had been sensibly diminished.",
    "LJ019-0135": "There was no monger or at worst but rarely and for short periods the same over crowding.",
    "LJ019-0136": "This was obviated by the frequent sessions of the central criminal court and the utilization of the two subsidiary prisons in giltspur street and southwark.",
    "LJ019-0137": "The prison population of newgate was still subject to great fluctuations but it seldom rose above two hundred and fifty or three hundred.",
    "LJ019-0138": "At the most crowded periods or just before the sessional jail delivery and at its lowest it fell sometimes to fifty or sixty.",
    "LJ019-0139": "These numbers would have still further decreased and the jail would have been almost empty but for the misdemenants who were still sent to newgate.",

    "LJ019-0143": "Drinking and gaming.",
    "LJ019-0144": "The indiscriminate visitation of friends and the almost unlimited admission of extra food these more glaring defects had disappeared.",
    "LJ019-0145": "But reformation was only skin deep below the surface many of the old evils still wrankled.",
    "LJ019-0146": "There was as yet no control over the prisoners after locking up time.",
    "LJ019-0147": "This occurred in summer at eight but in the winter months it took place at dusk and was often as early as four or five.",
    "LJ019-0148": "The prisoners were still left to themselves till next morning's unlocking.",
    "LJ019-0149": "And they spent some fourteen or fifteen hours in total darkness and almost without check or control.",
    "LJ019-0150": "Captain williams who was the inspector of prisons for the home district in succession to measures crawford and russell.",
    "LJ019-0151": "Stated in evidence that he was visiting newgate one night when he heard a great disturbance in one of the day and sleeping rooms.",
    "LJ019-0152": "And on entering it found the prisoners engaged in kicking bundles of wood from one end of the ward to the other.",
    "LJ019-0153": "Some attempt at supervision was exercised by the night watchman stationed on the leads who might hear what went on inside.",
    "LJ019-0154": "If any disturbance reached his ears he reported the case to the governor who next morning visited the ward in fault and asked for the culprit.",
    "LJ019-0155": "The inforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.",
    "LJ019-0156": "Unless the guilty prisoner was given up the whole ward was punished either by the exclusion of visitors or the deprivation of fire.",
    "LJ019-0157": "Sharp tests which generally broke down the fidelity of the inmates of the ward to one another.",
    "LJ019-0158": "Later on a more efficacious but still imperfect method of supervision was introduced iron cages which are still to be seen in newgate.",
    "LJ019-0159": "Were constructed on the landings insconced in which warders spent the night on duty and alert to watch the sleepers below.",
    "LJ019-0160": "And checked by remonstrance or threat of punishment all who broke the piece of the prison.",
    "LJ019-0161": "These disciplinary improvements were however only slowly and gradually introduced.",
    "LJ019-0162": "Other changes affecting the condition and proper treatment of prisoners were not made until the inspector had urged and recommended them.",
    "LJ019-0163": "Thus the wards which as i have said were left in complete darkness were now to be lighted with gas and after this most salutary edition.",
    "LJ019-0164": "The personal superintendents of night officers as already described became possible.",
    "LJ019-0165": "The rule became general as regards the prison dress hitherto clothing had been issued only to such as were destitute or in rags and all classes of prisoners.",

    "LJ019-0167": "Wore no distinguishing costume although its use was admitted not only for cleanliness but as a badge of condition and a security against escape.",
    "LJ019-0168": "Renewed recommendations to provide employment resulted in the provision of a certain amount of oakum for picking.",
    "LJ019-0169": "And one or two men were allowed to mend clothes and make shoes the rules made by the secretary of state were hung up in conspicuous parts of the prison.",
    "LJ019-0170": "More officers were appointed as the time of so many of those already on the staff was monopolized by attendance at the central criminal court.",
    "LJ019-0171": "Another custom which had led to disorder was abolished.",
    "LJ019-0172": "Prisoners who had been acquitted were not permitted to return to the prison to show their joy and receive the congratulations of their unfortunate fellows.",
    "LJ019-0173": "The corporation seems to have introduced these salutary changes without hesitation.",
    "LJ019-0174": "It was less prompt apparently in dealing with structural alterations and improvements.",
    "LJ019-0175": "Well founded complaints had been made of the want of heating appliances in the jail.",
    "LJ019-0176": "The wards had open fires but the separate cells were not warmed at all.",
    "LJ019-0177": "A scheme for heating the whole prison with hot water pipes after the system now generally adopted elsewhere was considered.",
    "LJ019-0178": "And abandoned because of the expense as to the entire reconstruction of newgate nothing had been done as yet.",
    "LJ019-0179": "This with a scheme for limiting the jail to untried prisoners had been urgently recommended by lord john russell in eighteen thirty.",
    "LJ019-0180": "His letter to the corporation under date fourth june.",
    "LJ019-0181": "Is an interesting document and shows that even at that date the government contemplated the erection of a model prisom.",

    "LJ019-0183": "Provided it was henceforth used only for untried prisoners suggested that newgate should be entirely reconstructed and the new building adopted as a model.",
    "LJ019-0184": "The corporation had agreed to spend twenty thousand pounds on alterations but sixty thousand pounds would suffice to reconstruct.",
    "LJ019-0185": "Lord john with great fairness admitted that the whole of this burthen could not be imposed upon the city.",
    "LJ019-0186": "Seeing that since the establishment of the central criminal court newgate received prisoners for trial from several counties.",
    "LJ019-0187": "And he was therefore prepared to submit to parliament a proposal that half the cost of reconstruction should be borne by public funds.",
    "LJ019-0188": "He forwarded plans prepared by the inspectors of prisons not for blind adoption but as a guide.",
    "LJ019-0189": "This plan was on the principle of cellular separation a system according to lord john russell desirable in all prisons.",
    "LJ019-0190": "But in a metropolitan prison absolutely essential the corporation in reply demerred rather to accepting strict separation as a rule.",
    "LJ019-0191": "Feeling that it approached too nearly to solitary confinement.",
    "LJ019-0192": "The court was however prepared to consider lord john russell's proposal with regard to the cost of rebuilding.",
    "LJ019-0193": "But as the plan was confessedly experimental for the benefit of the country generally the amount for which the city should be responsible should be distinctly limited.",
    "LJ019-0194": "Not to exceed a certain sum to be agreed upon.",
    "LJ019-0195": "A provisor was also made that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail.",
    "LJ019-0196": "Free from any other interference than that of the inspectors on the part of the government.",
    "LJ019-0197": "No doubt wiser counsels prevailed with lord john russell.",
    "LJ019-0198": "And on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing nuwgate site.",
    "LJ019-0199": "And the costliness of enlarging it forbade all idea of entirely reconstructing the jail so as to constitute it a model prison.",
    "LJ019-0200": "It would be far better to begin at the beginning.",
    "LJ019-0201": "To select a sufficiently spacious piece of ground and erect a prison which from foundations to roofs should be in conformity with the newest ideas.",
    "LJ019-0202": "The preference given to the pentenville system destroyed all hopes of a complete reformation of newgate.",
    "LJ019-0203": "But the condition of the great city jail was evidently considered a reproach by the city authorities and a year after the opening of the new model at pentenville.",
    "LJ019-0204": "A serious effort was made to reconstruct newgate.",
    "LJ019-0205": "In eighteen forty five the jail committee brought forward a definite proposal to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity for the erection of a new jail.",
    "LJ019-0206": "This jail was nominally to replace the giltsper street compter.",
    "LJ019-0207": "Site of which was to be sold to christ's hospital but the intention was of course to embody an absorb old newgate in the new construction.",
    "LJ019-0208": "The proposal made was to purchase some fifty thousand square feet between newgate warwick lane and the sessions house.",
    "LJ019-0209": "The situation having been proved by long experience to be salubrious.",
    "LJ019-0210": "But when this suggestion was brought before the court of alderman various amendments were proposed.",
    "LJ019-0211": "It was urged that the area selected for purchase must be excessively costly to acquire and still quite inadequate for the city needs.",
    "LJ019-0212": "The home secretary had laid it down that at least five acres would be indispensable and such an area it was impossible to obtain within the limits of the city.",
    "LJ019-0213": "Now for the first time the tuphnal estate in holloway was mentioned.",
    "LJ019-0214": "The corporation owned lands there covering from nineteen to twenty acres.",
    "LJ019-0215": "Why not move the city prison bodily into this more rural spot with its purer air and greater breathing space.",
    "LJ019-0216": "Eventually holloway was decided upon as a site for the new city prison.",
    "LJ019-0217": "The necessary preliminaries took some time but the contracts for the new building were completed in eighteen forty nine when the works were commenced.",
    "LJ019-0218": "The prison was to contain four hundred and four prisoners and the estimated expenditure was seventy nine thousand pounds.",
    "LJ019-0219": "It was to accommodate only the convicted prisoner's sentenced to terms short of penal servitude and after its completion.",
    "LJ019-0220": "The uses of newgate were narrowed almost entirely to those of a prison of detention.",
    "LJ019-0221": "It was intended as far as possible that except awaiting trial no prisoner should find himself relegated to newgate.",
    "LJ019-0222": "This principle became more and more generally the rule although it has never been punctiliously observed now and again.",
    "LJ019-0223": "Misdemeanants have found their way into newgate and within the last few years one offender against the privileges of the house of commons.",
    "LJ019-0224": "With the reduction of numbers to be accommodated there was ample space in newgate for its reconstruction on the most approved modern lines.",
    "LJ019-0225": "In eighteen fifty seven.",
    "LJ019-0226": "The erection of a wing or large block of cells was commenced within the original walls of the prison and upon the north or mail side.",
    "LJ019-0227": "This block contained one hundred and thirty cells embracing every modern improvement.",
    "LJ019-0228": "It also contained eleven reception cells six punishment cells and the couple of cells for condemned criminals.",
    "LJ019-0229": "This block was completed in eighteen fifty nine after which the hitherto unavoidable and long continued promiscuous association of prisoners.",
    "LJ019-0230": "In eighteen sixty one a similar work was undertaken to provide separate celular accommodation for the female in mates of newgate.",
    "LJ019-0231": "And by the following year forty seven new cells had been built on the most approved plan.",
    "LJ019-0232": "During this reconstruction the female prisoners were lodged in holloway.",
    "LJ019-0233": "And when it was completed both sides of the prison were brought into harmony with modern ideas.",
    "LJ019-0234": "The old buildings were entirely disused and the whole of the inmates of newgate were kept constantly in separate confinement.",
    "LJ019-0235": "With the last re edification of newgate a work executed some seven centuries after the first stone of the old jail was laid.",
    "LJ019-0236": "The architectural records of the prison end nothing much was done at newgate in the way of building outside or inn after eighteen sixty two.",
    "LJ019-0237": "The act for private executions led to the erection of the gallows shed in the exercising yard and at the flank of the passage from the condemned cells.",
    "LJ019-0238": "The first glass house or room in which prisoners could talk in private with their attorneys but yet be seen by the warder on the watch had been constructed.",
    "LJ019-0239": "And others were subsequently added.",
    "LJ019-0240": "But no structural alterations were made from the date first quoted until the time of closing the prison in eighteen eighty one.",
    "LJ019-0241": "But in the interval very comprehensive and i think it must be admitted salutary changes were successively introduced into the management of prisons.",
    "LJ019-0242": "Newgate naturally shared in any advantages due to these reforms i propose therefore to refer to them in the concluding pages of this work.",
    "LJ019-0243": "And thus bring the history of prison discipline down to our own times.",
    "LJ019-0244": "The last inquiry into the condition and management of our jails and houses of correction was that made by the lord's committee in eighteen sixty three.",
    "LJ019-0245": "The inquiry was most searching and complete and the committee spoke plainly in its report.",
    "LJ019-0246": "It animadverted strongly on the many and wide differences as regards construction labor diet and general discipline.",
    "LJ019-0247": "Which existed in the various prisons.",
    "LJ019-0248": "Leading to an inequality uncertainty and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results.",
    "LJ019-0249": "The varieties in construction were still very market.",
    "LJ019-0250": "In many prisons the prisoners were still associated and from the want of a sufficient number of cells the principle of separation was still greatly neglected.",
    "LJ019-0251": "Yet this principle as the committee pointed out must now be accepted as the foundation of prison discipline.",
    "LJ019-0252": "While its rigid maintenance was in its opinion vital to the efficiency of the jails.",
    "LJ019-0253": "Even where cells had been built.",
    "LJ019-0254": "They were frequently below the standard size and were therefore not certified for occupation as was required by law.",
    "LJ019-0255": "Great numbers were not lighted at night and were without means by which their inmates could communicate in case of urgent necessity with their keepers.",
    "LJ019-0256": "Still greater were the differences with regard to employment the various authorities held widely different opinions as to what constituted hard labour.",
    "LJ019-0257": "Here the tread wheel was in use there cellular cranks or hard labor machines.",
    "LJ019-0258": "Both however varied greatly in mechanism and in the amount of energy they called forth.",
    "LJ019-0259": "While the former was intended for the congregate labour of a number and the latter as its name implies imposed continuous solitary toil.",
    "LJ019-0260": "At other prisons shot drill the lifting and carrying of heavy round shot was the favorite method of inflicting penal labor.",
    "LJ019-0261": "With these differences were others as opposed concerning industrial occupation.",
    "LJ019-0262": "The jail authorities often gave the highest possibly undue importance to the value of remunerative employment.",
    "LJ019-0263": "And sought to make profitable returns from prisoner's labour the test of prison efficiency in this view the committee could not coincide.",
    "LJ019-0264": "And it was decidedly of opinion that in all short sentences the hard labour of the tread wheel crank and so forth should be the invariable rule.",
    "LJ019-0265": "In dietaries again the same wide diversity of practice obtained.",
    "LJ019-0266": "Efforts made by sir james graham years before to introduce uniformity in this particular had failed of effect.",

    "LJ019-0270": "Vegetables especially the potato that most valuable anti scorbutic was too often omitted.",
    "LJ019-0271": "In a word the value of diet as a part of penal discipline was still insufficiently recognized.",
    "LJ019-0272": "The prisons were still far from inflicting the three punishments hard labor hard fare and a hard bed.",
    "LJ019-0273": "Which sir joshuad jeb told the committee he considered the proper elements of penal discipline.",
    "LJ019-0274": "It is interesting to note here.",
    "LJ019-0275": "That the committee of eighteen sixty three fully endorsed sir joshua's recommendations as regards a hard bed and recommended that.",
    "LJ019-0276": "During short sentences or the earlier stages of a long confinement.",
    "LJ019-0277": "The prisoners should be made to dispense with the use of a mattress and should sleep on planks.",
    "LJ019-0278": "This suggestion was adopted in the act of eighteen sixty five which followed the committee's report and of which more directly.",
    "LJ019-0279": "Laws ninety two schedule one of that act authorized the use of plank beds which were adopted in many prisons.",
    "LJ019-0280": "They are now the universal rule.",

    "LJ019-0282": "They are origin it will be seen dates back much further than that.",
    "LJ019-0283": "Beds might well be made hard and their use strictly limited.",
    "LJ019-0284": "According to this committee of eighteen sixty three beds in the smaller and most carelessly conducted prisons formed a large element in the life of a prisoner.",
    "LJ019-0285": "In one jail fifteen hours were spent in bed out of the twenty four this was in keeping with other grave deffects and emissions.",
    "LJ019-0286": "The minor borough prisons were the worst blot on the still dark and imperfect system.",
    "LJ019-0287": "They were very numerous very imperfect in construction and management and they were very little required.",
    "LJ019-0288": "In them according to the committee the old objectionable practices were still in full force.",
    "LJ019-0289": "Here was unrestrained association of untried and convicted juvenile with adult prisoners vagrants misdemenants felons.",
    "LJ019-0290": "There were dormitories without light control or regulation at night.",
    "LJ019-0291": "Which warders dreading assault were afraid to enter after dark even to check rioting and disturbance.",
    "LJ019-0292": "Prisoners still slept two in a bed.",

    "LJ019-0294": "The prison buildings were in many places out of repair other houses often overlooked them.",
    "LJ019-0295": "Single officer was te only custodian and disciplinary authority in the jail.",
    "LJ019-0296": "Complete idleness was tolerated there was neither penal labor nor light employment.",
    "LJ019-0297": "The prisoners intercommunicated freely and exercised the most injurious corrupting influences upon one another.",
    "LJ019-0298": "The total want of administration was very market.",
    "LJ019-0299": "But in one prison it was such that the prisoner's food was supplied daily from the neighbouring inn and the innkeeper's bill constituted the only accounts kept.",
    "LJ019-0300": "The committee might well suggest the abolition of these jails or their amalgamation with the larger county establishments in their immediate neighborhood.",
    "LJ019-0301": "Some idea of the comparative uselessness of these small borough prisons was conveyed by some figures quoted by the committee.",
    "LJ019-0302": "In eighteen sixty two there were in all one hundred and ninety three jails in england and wales.",
    "LJ019-0303": "Of these sixty three gave admittance during the entire year to less than twenty five prisoners.",
    "LJ019-0304": "Twenty two others received between eleven and twenty five.",

    "LJ019-0306": "While twenty seven received less than six prisoners and were in some instances absolutely tenantless.",
    "LJ019-0307": "The result of the recommendation of the committee of eighteen sixty two was the prison act of eighteen sixty five.",
    "LJ019-0308": "He penultimate such enactments many of the provisions of which still remain in force.",
    "LJ019-0309": "The main object of this act was to compass that uniformity in discipline and treatment generally.",
    "LJ019-0310": "Which had long been admitted as indispensable and had never as yet been properly obtained.",
    "LJ019-0311": "The legislature was beginning to overcome its disinclination to interfere actively or authoritatively.",
    "LJ019-0312": "With the local jurisdictions although still very leniently disposed.",
    "LJ019-0313": "However it now laid down in plain language and with precise details the requirements of a good jail system.",

    "LJ019-0319": "While the latter which included various forms of industrial employment.",
    "LJ019-0320": "Was the boon to which willing industry extending over a long period established a certain claim.",
    "LJ019-0321": "The infliction of punishment more or less uniform was thus aimed at.",
    "LJ019-0322": "On the other hand new and careful regulations were framed to secure the moral and material well being of the inmates of the jails.",

    "LJ019-0339": "While decency and good order were to be insured by the strict prohibition of gambling and drunkenness.",

    "LJ026-0056": "It is however impossible for the animal to build these materials directly into the substance of its own body.",
    "LJ026-0057": "They must first undergo certain preparatory chemical changes known collectively as digestion.",
    "LJ026-0058": "And only after the completion of this process can all the food be absorbed into the circulation.",
    "LJ026-0059": "For this purpose the food is taken not into the body proper but into a kind of tubular chemical laboratory called the elimentary canal.",
    "LJ026-0060": "Through which it slowly passes being subjected meanwhile to the action of certain chemical substances or regients known as digestive ferments.",
    "LJ026-0061": "These substances which are dissolved in a watery liquid to form the digestive fluid are secreted by the walls of the elimentary tube.",
    "LJ026-0062": "Through their action the solid portions are liquified and the food is rendered capable of absorption into the body proper.",
    "LJ026-0063": "The food supply of the higher plant like that of the animal is the source of the required matter and energy.",
    "LJ026-0064": "But unlike that of the animal it is not chiefly an income of foods but only of the raw materials of food.",

    "LJ026-0070": "Of the substances the solids salts et cetera must be dissolved in water before they can be taken in.",
    "LJ026-0071": "Water and dissolved salts continually passd by diffusion from the soil into the roots where together they constitute the sap.",

    "LJ026-0080": "Often in the form of granules embedded in the chlorifil bodies and free oxygen most of which is returned to the atmosphere.",
    "LJ026-0081": "Thus the leaf of a green plant in the light is continually absorbing carbondioxide and giving forth free oxygen.",
    "LJ026-0082": "Carbon dioxide and water contain no potential energy since the affinities of their constituent elements are completely satisfied.",
    "LJ026-0083": "Starch however contains potential energy since the molecule is relatively unstable.",

    "LJ026-0086": "The connetic energy of sunlight was expended in lifting the atoms into position of vantage thus endowing them with energy of position.",
    "LJ026-0087": "In this way some of the radiant and connetic energy of the sun comes to be stored up as potential energy in the starch.",

    "LJ026-0090": "This power is possessed by green plants alone all other organisms being dependent for energy upon the potential energy of ready made food.",

    "LJ026-0092": "Animals and colourless plants as well apparently could not long exist.",
    "LJ026-0093": "The plant absorbs also a small amount of connetic energy independently of the sunlight in the form of heat.",

    "LJ026-0100": "In the plant the inorganic matter in water from the soil are absorbed by the roots and carried up definite tubes in the woody part of the stem.",
    "LJ026-0101": "The causes of this ascent are not clear.",
    "LJ026-0102": "But roote pressure due to osmosis capillary action and evaporation from the leaves are factors.",
    "LJ026-0103": "Just as the solid food of animals must be digested in preparation for absorption.",
    "LJ026-0104": "So starch manufactured in the leaves must be digested dissolved before it can be transported.",
    "LJ026-0105": "This is done by diastaces and enzeim of plant cells.",
    "LJ026-0106": "The change is from starch to a sugar capable of diffusion.",
    "LJ026-0107": "Dissolved in water the sugar is transported down delicate tubes chiefly in the growing bark region of the stem.",
    "LJ026-0108": "It is clear that there are upward and downward currents of water containing food comparable to blood of an animal.",
    "LJ026-0109": "But no system of complete circulation as in the blood vessels of a higher animal.",
    "LJ026-0110": "However the result in distributed food is the same in the plant and in the animal.",
    "LJ026-0111": "In the cells the foods undergo metabolic changes.",
    "LJ026-0112": "In an animal the foods in the circulating liquids blood and limph are selected and absorbed by the cells.",
    "LJ026-0113": "Only protide foods form new protoplasm.",
    "LJ026-0114": "And even of protides only a limited amount seventy five to one hundred grams a day for a man is built into new protoplasm.",

    "LJ026-0116": "The foods containing only the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen fats and carbo hydrates.",
    "LJ026-0117": "Are directly oxidized to excretions and lacking nitrogen cannot serve from making new animal protoplasm.",
    "LJ026-0118": "Fat and carbohydrate foods then never become living matter.",
    "LJ026-0119": "They may be stored especially as fet until needed for oxidation to supply energy.",
    "LJ026-0120": "The building up of the protoplazm from protides is anabolism constructive metabolism.",
    "LJ026-0121": "The destruction of protoplasm excess protides or the fat and carbo hydrate foods is catabolism destructive metabolism.",
    "LJ026-0122": "Catabolism is probably due to ensime action but the final result is chiefly carbondioxide and water.",
    "LJ026-0123": "Which could be derived by the ordinary chemical evolution of protoplasm protide sugar starch or fats.",
    "LJ026-0124": "In the plant starch as has been seen is first formed in the chlorofille bodies.",
    "LJ026-0125": "But the formation of starch all important as it is is after all only the manufacture of food.",
    "LJ026-0126": "As a preliminary to the real processes of nutrition.",
    "LJ026-0127": "These processes must take place everywhere in ordinary protoplasm.",
    "LJ026-0128": "For it is here that ocidation occurs and the need for a renewal of matter and energy consequently arises.",
    "LJ026-0129": "Sooner or later the starch grains are changed into a kind of sugar gluccos which unlike starch dissolves in the sap.",
    "LJ026-0130": "And may thus be easily transported to all parts of the plant.",
    "LJ026-0131": "Wherever there is need for new protoplasm whether to repair previous waste or to supply materials for growth.",
    "LJ026-0132": "After absorption into the cells the elements of the starch or glucos are bidle living protoplasm in some unknown way.",
    "LJ026-0133": "Combined with nitrogen and sulphur probably also with salts water et cetera to form protide matter.",
    "LJ026-0134": "The particles of this newly formed compound are incorporated into the protoplasm.",
    "LJ026-0135": "If a larger quantity of starch is formed in the chlorofille bodies than is immediately needed by the protoplasm for purposes of repair or growth.",
    "LJ026-0136": "It may be reconverted into starch after journeying as glucos through the plant.",
    "LJ026-0137": "And be laid down as reserve starch in the cells of root or stem or elsewhere.",
    "LJ026-0138": "Apparently when this reserve supply is finally needed at any point in the plant it is again changed to gluccos and transported thither.",
    "LJ026-0139": "It is probable that new leaves and new tissues generally are always formed in part from this reserve starch.",
    "LJ026-0140": "In the plant as in the animal metabolism must consist of anabolic and catabolic processes.",
    "LJ026-0141": "The construction in the cells of new protide from the absorbed carbohydrate and the materials from the soil is true anabolism.",
    "LJ026-0142": "It is also clear that catabolism or ocidation for the liberation of energy occurs as in animals but this process is slower.",
    "LJ026-0143": "Probably foods containing carbon hydrogen and oxygen are the sources of energy and the higher plants as in animals.",
    "LJ026-0144": "In both plants and animals simple waste substances result from the catabolic processes in the celves.",
    "LJ026-0145": "In the animal carbon dioxide water and nitrogen compounds are the chief excretions.",
    "LJ026-0146": "They are absorbed by the circulating liquids and carried to the eliminating organs lungs and kidneys chiefly for elimination.",
    "LJ026-0147": "In the higher plants the excretions are carbondioxide which escapes through the epidermus of root stem and leaf and through the stamata.",
    "LJ026-0148": "Water which is lost by evaporation especially from the leaf's surface through the stamata.",
    "LJ026-0149": "Excretions which are lost by asmosis through the roots and the accumulated but useless mineral substances which are eliminated by leaf fall.",
    "LJ026-0150": "In both animals and plants oxygen is essential to the catabolic part of metabolism.",
    "LJ026-0151": "Hence oxygen must be supplied to the cells.",
    "LJ026-0152": "Oxygenation is the term used to denote the oxygen supplying part of respiration.",
    "LJ026-0153": "The other part of respiration elimination of carbon dioxide has been treated under excretions.",
    "LJ026-0154": "In the animal oxygen is absorbed by the blood in excess by the hemoglobin of the red cells of the blood.",
    "LJ026-0155": "And later is absorbed from the blood and limph by all the living cells.",
    "LJ026-0156": "In the plant also oxygen is absorbed through the epidermus and stomato from the air.",
    "LJ026-0157": "This process is however obscured during the day because of the oxygen freed in the manufacture of starch which goes on at that time.",
    "LJ026-0158": "Probably this freed oxygen is used for the purpose of oxyge nation but more is freed in the photosynthetic process than is needed for oxygenation.",
    "LJ026-0159": "And hence the excess oxygen is eliminated while starch manufacture is in process.",
    "LJ026-0160": "In comparing a higher animal and a green plant confusion must be avoided regarding the park played by oxygen and carbon dioxide in true respiration.",
    "LJ026-0161": "With the part played by the same substances in starch formation photosynthesis.",
    "LJ026-0162": "In non green plants like the indian pipe and mushrooms the breathing of oxygen and the excretion of carbondioxide are as in the animal.",

    "LJ027-0034": "Hence as jordan has said the inside of an animal tells the real history of its ancestry the outside tells us only where its ancestors have been.",
    "LJ027-0035": "In the second place it must be noted that adaptations to similar conditions may result in superficial resemblances.",

    "LJ027-0113": "Of course the theory of descent with adaptive modification has a simple answer to supply.",
    "LJ027-0114": "Namely that when from changed conditions of life an organ which was previously useful becomes useless.",
    "LJ027-0115": "It will be suffered to dwindle away in successive generations under the influence of certain natural causes.",
    "LJ027-0116": "On the other hand the theory of special creation can only maintain that these rudiments are formed for the sake of adhering to an ideal type.",
    "LJ027-0117": "Now here again the former theory appears to be triumphant over the latter says romaynes.",
    "LJ027-0118": "For without waiting to dispute the wisdom of making dwarfed and useless structures merely for the whimsical motive assigned.",
    "LJ027-0119": "Surely if such a method were adopted in so many cases we should expect that inconsistency it would be adopted in all cases.",
    "LJ027-0120": "This reasonable expectation however is far from being realized.",
    "LJ027-0121": "In numberless cases such as that of the four limbs of serpents no vestige of a rudiment is present.",
    "LJ027-0122": "But the vacillating policy in the matter of rudiments does not end here for it is shown in a still more aggravated form.",
    "LJ027-0123": "Where within the limits of the same natural group of organisms a rudiment is sometimes present and sometimes absent.",
    "LJ027-0124": "For instance although in nearly all the numerous species of snakes there are no vestiges of limbs.",
    "LJ027-0125": "In the python we find very tiny rudiments of the hind limbs now.",
    "LJ027-0126": "Is it a worthy conception of deity that.",
    "LJ027-0127": "While neglecting to maintain his unity of ideal in the case of nearly all the numerous species of snakes he should have added a tiny rudiment in the case of the piton.",
    "LJ027-0128": "And even in that case should have maintained his ideal very inefficiently inasmuch as only two limbs instead of four are represented.",
    "LJ027-0129": "Convincing as are the evidences of descent recorded in the structure of plants and animals.",
    "LJ027-0130": "These evidences have been in the past thirty years somewhat overshadowed by the far more surprising evidences.",
    "LJ027-0131": "Of descent discovered in the development of plant and animal embryos.",
    "LJ027-0132": "A dozen volumes would be necessary.",
    "LJ027-0133": "To present the mass of embriological evidence but a few salient facts will illustrate the kind of evidence to be deduced from embraology.",
    "LJ027-0134": "Most remarkable of all the principles which have been discovered by embraologists is the recapitulation doctrine.",
    "LJ027-0135": "Which briefly stated is that individual development antogeni recapitulates ancestral history philogeni.",
    "LJ027-0136": "Illustrations quoted from the works of romanes and laconte will make this principle clear.",
    "LJ027-0137": "It is an observable fact as romaynes.",
    "LJ027-0138": "That there is often a close correspondence between developmental changes as revealed by any chronological series of fossils which may happen to have been preserved.",
    "LJ027-0139": "And developmental changes which may be observed during the life history of now existing individuals belonging to the same group of animals.",
    "LJ027-0141": "Is closely reproduced in the life history of existing deer or in other words.",
    "LJ027-0142": "The antlers of an existing deer furnish in their development a kind of resume or recapitulation of the successive phases.",
    "LJ027-0143": "Whereby the primitive horn was gradually superseded by horns presenting a greater and greater number of prongs in successive species of extinct deer.",
    "LJ027-0144": "Now it must be obvious.",
    "LJ027-0145": "That such a recapitulation in the life history of an existing animal of developmental changes successively distinctive of sundry allied.",
    "LJ027-0146": "Though now extinct species speak strongly in favour of evolution.",
    "LJ027-0147": "For as it is of the essence of this theory that new forms arise from older forms by way of hereditary discent.",
    "LJ027-0148": "We should antecedently expect if the theory is true.",
    "LJ027-0149": "That the phases of development presented by the individual organism would follow in their main outlines those phases of development.",
    "LJ027-0150": "Through which their long line of ancestors had passed.",
    "LJ027-0151": "The only alternative view is that as species of deer.",
    "LJ027-0152": "For instance were separately created additional prungs were successively added to their amplers and yet that.",
    "LJ027-0153": "In order to be so added to successive species every individual deer belonging to later species was required to repeat in his own lifetime.",
    "LJ027-0154": "The process of successive editions which had previously taken place in a remote series of extinct species.",
    "LJ027-0155": "Now i do not deny that this view is a possible view but i do deny that it is a probable one.",
    "LJ027-0156": "According to the evolutionary interpretation of such facts we can see a very good reason why the life history of the individual.",
    "LJ027-0157": "Is thus a condensed resume of the life history of its ancestral species.",
    "LJ027-0158": "But according to the opposite view no reason can be assigned why such should be the case.",
    "LJ027-0159": "It is well known likewise comments lucante.",
    "LJ027-0160": "That the embryo or lava of a frog or toad when first hatched is a legless tail swimming water breathing gill breathing animal.",
    "LJ027-0161": "It is essentially a fish and would be so classed if it remained in this condition.",
    "LJ027-0162": "The fish retains permanently this form but the frog passes on.",
    "LJ027-0163": "Next it forms first one pair and then another pair of legs and meanwhile it begins to breathe also by lungs.",
    "LJ027-0164": "At this stage it breathes equally by lungs and by gills i e both air and water.",
    "LJ027-0165": "Now the lower forms of amphibians such as syradon menobrachus cyron et cetera.",
    "LJ027-0166": "Retain permanently this form and are therefore called perenibrancs but the frog still passes on.",
    "LJ027-0167": "Then the gills gradually dry up as the lungs develop and they now breathe wholly by lungs but still retain the tail.",
    "LJ027-0168": "Now this is the permanent mature condition of many anphibians.",
    "LJ027-0169": "Such as the triton the salamander et cetera which are therefore called cadusebronchs but the frog still passes on.",
    "LJ027-0170": "Finally it loses the tail or rather its tail is absorbed and its material used in further development and it becomes a perfect frog.",
    "LJ027-0171": "The highest order anura of this class thus then in antageni the fish goes no further than the fish stages.",
    "LJ027-0172": "The parenibranc passes through the fish stage to the parenibrac amphibian.",
    "LJ027-0173": "The caducibronc takes first the fish form then the parenibrach form and finally the coducibronc form but goes no further.",
    "LJ027-0174": "Last the anura takes first the fish form then that of the parenebrac then that of the cadusebranc and finally becomes anura.",
    "LJ027-0175": "Now this is undoubtedly the order of succession of forms in geological times i e in the pilogenic ceries.",
    "LJ027-0176": "Fishes first appeared in the devonian and upper cilorian in very reptillian or rather amphibian forms.",
    "LJ027-0177": "Then in the carboniferus fishes still continuing there appeared the lowest ie most fishlike forms of amphibians.",
    "LJ027-0178": "These were undoubtedly perenibrancs in the permian and triassic higher forms appeared which were certainly coducibranc.",

    "LJ028-0036": "But in those very early days babylon was little more than a shrine surrounded with mud huts and date palms.",
    "LJ028-0037": "It was about twenty two fifty b c when the great hamarabi made it his capital that it became the chief city of babylonia.",

    "LJ032-0187": "The fact that on the morning of the assassination oswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibres most probably originated.",
    "LJ032-0188": "Provides some evidence that they were placed on the rifle that day.",
    "LJ032-0189": "Since there was limited if any opportunity for oswald to handle the weapon during the two months prior to november twenty two.",
    "LJ032-0190": "On the other hand stomball pointed out that fibres might retain their freshness if the rifle had been.",
    "LJ032-0191": "Quote put aside and quote after catching the fibres.",
    "LJ032-0192": "The rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a blanket for about eight weeks prior to november twenty two.",
    "LJ032-0193": "Because the relative freshness of these fibres might be explained by the continuous storage of the rifle in the blanket.",
    "LJ032-0194": "The commission was unable to reach any firm conclusion as to when the fibres were caught in the rifle.",
    "LJ032-0195": "The commission was able to conclude however that the fibres most probably came from oswald's shirt.",

    "LJ033-0181": "The science of paper analysis enabled him to distinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were produced by the same manufacturer.",

    "LJ035-0078": "Then howlit walked down the stairway to the second floor landing and entered the lunch room.",
    "LJ035-0079": "The first test run at normal walking pace required one minute eighteen seconds.",

    "LJ035-0090": "Possible delayed reaction to the shot jostling with the crowd of people on the steps and scanning the area along elm street and the parkway.",
    "LJ035-0091": "Baker said qute we simulated the shots and by the time we got there we did everything that i did that day.",
    "LJ035-0092": "And this would be the minimum because i'm sure that i you know it took me a little longer and e.",
    "LJ035-0093": "On the basis of this time test therefore.",
    "LJ035-0094": "The commission concluded that oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the second floor lunch room when seen by baker and truly.",
    "LJ035-0095": "That oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second floor lunch room.",
    "LJ035-0096": "Is consistent with the movements of the two elevators which would have provided the other possible means of dissent.",
    "LJ035-0097": "When truly accompanied by baker ran to the rear of the first floor.",
    "LJ035-0098": "He was certain that both elevators which occupy the same shaft were on the fifth floor.",
    "LJ035-0099": "Baker not realizing that there were two elevators thought that only one elevator was in the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second floor.",
    "LJ035-0100": "In the few seconds which elapsed while baker and truly ran from the first to the second floor.",
    "LJ035-0101": "Neither of these slow elevators could have descended from the fifth to the second floor furthermore no elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.",

    "LJ035-0109": "But in his testimony piper did not mention either seeing or talking with dority during these moments of excitement.",
    "LJ035-0110": "Both dorty and piper were confused witnesses they had no exact memory of the events of that afternoon.",
    "LJ035-0111": "Truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the first floor.",
    "LJ035-0112": "The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when baker and truly reached that floor.",
    "LJ035-0113": "Probably because jack doridy took it to the first floor while baker and truly were running up the stairs or in the lunch room with oswald.",

    "LJ035-0115": "Oswald's use of the stairways consistent with the testimony of other employes in the building.",
    "LJ035-0116": "Three employes james jarmon junior.",

    "LJ035-0119": "Until after they saw patroman baker's white helmet on the fifth floor moving toward the elevator.",
    "LJ035-0120": "While they were at the west windows their view of the stairwall was completely blocked by shelves and boxes.",
    "LJ035-0121": "This is the period during which oswald would have descended the stairs in all likelihood.",
    "LJ035-0122": "Doredy took the elevator down from the fifth floor after jarmon norman and williams ran to the west windows and were deciding what to do.",
    "LJ035-0123": "None of these three men saw dorty probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because of the books which may have blocked the view.",
    "LJ035-0124": "Neither jarmon norman williams or dorty saw oswald.",

    "LJ035-0128": "If her estimate of time is correct she reached the bottom of the stairs before truly and baker started up.",
    "LJ035-0129": "And she must have run down the stairs ahead of oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.",
    "LJ035-0130": "Actually she noticed no one on the back stairs if she descended from the fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony.",
    "LJ035-0131": "She would have seen baker or truly on the first floor or on the stairs unless they were already in the second floor lunch room talking to oswald.",

    "LJ035-0139": "They re entered the building by the rear door several minutes after baker and truley rushed through the front entrance.",
    "LJ035-0140": "On entering love lady saw a girl on the first floor who he believes was victoria adams.",
    "LJ035-0141": "If miss adams accurately recalled meeting shelley and love lady when she reached the bottom of the stairs.",
    "LJ035-0142": "Then her estimate of the time when she descended from the fourth floor is incorrect.",

    "LJ039-0211": "Moreover the defect was one which would have assisted the assassin aiming at a target which was moving away.",
    "LJ039-0212": "Fraser said ue the fact that the cross hairs are set high would actually compensate for any lead which had to be taken.",

    "LJ039-0233": "On the basis of oswald's training and the accuracy of the weapon as established by the tests.",
    "LJ039-0234": "The commission concluded that oswald was capable of accomplishing this second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed.",

    "LJ040-0024": "Perhaps the most outstanding conclusion of such a study is that oswald was profoundly alienated from the world in which he lived.",
    "LJ040-0025": "His life was characterized by isolation frustration and failure.",

    "LJ040-0049": "He stated several times that he was a communist but apparently never joined any communist party.",
    "LJ040-0050": "His attachment to marxest and communist doctrine was probably in some measure an expression of his hostility to his environment.",
